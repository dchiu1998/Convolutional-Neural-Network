# Convolutional-Neural-Network
An artificial neural network trained to recognize images from the cifar10 dataset. Includes 3 convolution layers, 3 feed-forward layers
and max pooling.

In order to start training, include the CIFAR10 dataset in the root directory specified by 'trainset' and 'loadset'.
Set 'download' to "True" in the 'trainset' and 'loadset' variables if the dataset is not already downloaded. 
Change 'MODEL_PATH' to a path to save the model.
Set 'LEARNING_RATE' and 'MOMENTUM' variables to define optimization parameters.

A previously trained model is already included in the repository.
